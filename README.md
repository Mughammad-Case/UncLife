# 🗣️ UncLife (CLI Life Simulation Game)

> _A console-based life simulation game about navigating peak unc status_

---

You wake up in 2026.
You're 25.
Still living at your parents' house.

**_Something changes._**

## What is UncLife?

UncLife drops you into the slow-burn reality of adult life and asks one question: _what are you actually going to do about it?_

Make decisions. Watch the months pass. Let your choices influence your reality.

> **"Unc"** - Gen Z/Alpha slang for _uncle_. Used online to describe someone who's old, getting old, or just... acting like it. "Unc status" is a vibe. An era. A warning.

Will you become a successful unc?
Or slowly fade into irrelevance?
